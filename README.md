# Granalytics

Granalytics is a front- and back-end gem to easily implement self-hosted
analytics within your Rails app, making it easy to build analytics
dashboards for your users, within the app. You can easily create siloed
buckets of analytics, so that one account can't see the analytics from
another account.

Granalytics was developed by [Alfa Jango](http://www.alfajango.com) for
[GradeCraft](http://www.gradecraft.com).
